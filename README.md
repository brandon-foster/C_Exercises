C_Exercises
===========

Exercises following along with "Learn C The Hard Way" (http://c.learncodethehardway.org/) by Zed Shaw

## Notes

- Branch exercise2 was merged into master without a pull request. 
- Branch exercise2 did not create an ex2.c file, but modified the existing ex1.c file.
- Branch ex4_UsingValgrind begins using a new naming convention for branches
- Branch ex4_UsingValgrind intentionally breaks a copy of ex3.c to see valgrind's output
- Branch ex6_DataTypes intentionally prints "", to familiarize myself with printf's behavior
